# Closed-Loop tACS–fMRI Frontoparietal Optimization

This repository contains code and analysis pipelines for a randomized, double-arm closed-loop tACS–fMRI study. Stimulation frequency and phase between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F4) and right inferior parietal cortex (P4) were iteratively optimized using real-time fMRI-based frontoparietal functional connectivity during a 2-back working memory task. The framework demonstrates the feasibility of individualized, network-specific neuromodulation using real-time connectivity optimization.

## Background and Prior Work

This closed-loop tACS–fMRI framework builds on our previously published conceptual work introducing real-time, network-guided neuromodulation using concurrent stimulation and fMRI:

We subsequently evaluated the **safety, tolerability, and feasibility** of this closed-loop tACS–fMRI pipeline in a dedicated protocol study:
